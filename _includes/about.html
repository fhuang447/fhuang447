          Hi! I’m Felix, a research scientist currently doing in vivo and in vitro work with humanized mouse models.
          My expertise is mainly in hepatic models, with a focus on infectious diseases (HBV, Malaria) and toxicology.
          I have a deep interest in data—especially scientific and healthcare data. I’m currently a graduate student in the Data Science program at Willamette University,
          and I hope to merge my biological expertise with data science skills to further my research.
